.. py:function:: gen_resample_grid(grid_res_x, grid_res_y, bbox_coord_limits)

   Generate resample grid to the bbox coordinate limits

   :param grid_res_x:
   :param grid_res_y:
   :param bbox_coord_limits: is expected to be a list or tuple with 4 elements as follows: [xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax]

.. py:function:: gen_resample_grid_bbox_min(grid_res_x, grid_res_y, bbox_minimal)

   Generate resample grid bbox minimum

   :param grid_res_x:
   :param grid_res_y:
   :param bbox_minimal: shall have has shape [4,2] and consists of four points describing the corner of the minimal
       bounding box.

       The width of the box is taken as the distance between point [0,:] and [3,:].

       The height of the box is taken as the distance between point [2,:] and [3,:].

       The x direction is taken as the direction going from point [3,:] to point [0,:].

       The y direction is taken as the direction going from point [3,:] to point [2,:].
