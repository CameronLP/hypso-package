.. py:function:: convolve2d(slab, kernel, max_missing = 0.5, verbose = True)

   2D convolution with missings ignored

   :param slab: 2d array. Input array to convolve. Can have numpy.nan or masked values.
   :param kernel: 2d array, convolution kernel, must have sizes as odd numbers.
   :param max_missing: float in (0,1), max percentage of missing in each convolution
       window is tolerated before a missing is placed in the result.
   :param verbose: Default to True.

   :return: 2d array, convolution result. Missings are represented as
       numpy.nans if they are in <slab>, or masked if they are masked
       in <slab>.
